# Strider React App Coding Assignment


### Background
A store called Strider General Store recently opened in your town. The owners have a simple database to store customer purchase information and a few queries they run to look at the data. Now, however, they want a UI to show them detailed information about a purchase, and they have asked you to help them get this UI up and running.

Using the receipts provided here: https://doc.strider.tech/content/receipts.json, design a UI to showcase information about the data. Note: The instructions are intentionally vague to allow you to design the UI how you think best meets the requirements:

### Requirements
1.	Create a React app using create-react-app which utilizes the following packages:
    *	Material UI – Used to design page elements
    *	React Router – Used to route to different pages
2.	On the home page:
    *	Display some high-level stats about the orders.
    *	Display links that will take you to a page about a specific customer which shows their order history.
    *	Display a link for each item which will take you to a page that shows the number of times that item has been ordered.
3.	Additionally, any information you think might be beneficial to see on the pages would be great. Be creative!
4.	Do Not add the json file to the application for your fetch request.

### Bonuses
1.	Demonstrate use of React hooks.
2.	Showcase usage of Material UI tables to show the data.
3.	Add different graphs that can showcase stats in a meaningful way.
4.	Unit tests.

When you have completed the assignment, please upload the code to Greenhouse. Make sure to include a README with any necessary instructions to run the app.
