# SQL Server Assignment

### Background
A new store called Strider General Store has just opened in your town, and the owners have asked you to help them set up a database to store customer purchase information. A few customers have already been in the shop, so the owners hand you a few receipts and ask you to keep track of all of the information on the receipts. A few days later, you show them the database you have set up, and they are very impressed! Now they start asking you questions about the data. “Which product do we sell the most? Who’s our best customer? Who has shopped here the most?” You return to your desk and write up some queries so that they can get this information whenever they want. 

Assignment Receipts are provided to you in JSON format. You can access the data here:
https://doc.strider.tech/content/receipts.json.
Please provide the following in a SQL file:
1. Create table statements to set up tables that hold the information provided in the
receipts.
2. Insert commands to insert all the data from the JSON file.
3. Scripts that answer the following questions:
    * Which of the customers are repeat customers?
    * Which customer has spent the most at the store?
    * How many customers have shopped at the store?
    * Which item has been purchased the most?

If you need a SQL editor to test your code, we recommend the following playground:

Make sure that the database is set to SQL Server 2019 in the top left of the website.
